CallFlash! Flash alert on Calls, SMS & Instant Messaging apps!
========================================================================

CallFlash controls the flash for calls and other notifications. This way you can be notified by your flash for every notification. It is an opensource project, aiming to keep things simple and functional.

If you want any third party app to be added in the list just email me at bigappledev@gmail.com.

IF THE FLASH DOESN'T TURN ON CHANGE THE FLASH DRIVER FROM PREFERENCES->MODULE DRIVER. THERE ARE THREE AVAILABLE.
Prefer Standard over Alternative and Alternative over Alternative 2. If the flash doesn't turn on with either of these drivers send me an email at bigappledev@gmail.com.

Before rating bad please try all three flash drivers from settings. Samsung devices tend to work with the Alternative driver only. Thanks

*********************
If your phone starts talking after enabling the "Notification Service" this is a Samsung-Talkback issue:

Unfortunately there isn't much I can do for that. There are many solutions out there. Choose what works for you.
